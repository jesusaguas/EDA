# EDA
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms projects

This project consists in an implementation of a question contest, in "practica1" we can find the collection of participants with an intern iterator, and in "practica2" there is the implementation of the contest. 

- "practica1" has a lineal implementation in dynamic memory in C++ of the generic ATD "Selection Round".
- "practica2" has a tree implementation in dynamic memory in C++ of the generic ATD "Time Stamp Collection".

In the directory practica2 these two ATD are also used to create the question contest main program: "practica2.cpp"
